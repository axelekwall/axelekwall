# what's up in your hood?

I wanted to find out more about how people in different countries feel about their neighbours. What do they care about and is there any correlations to be found in the data?

My first step was to go to the "World Values Survey" website to see if I could find the data I needed for my question. I realised that there was a lot of interesting data but the tools on the World Values Surveys website wasn't powerful enough to give a good picture.

To get a better picture of how people all over the world feel about their neighbours, I created a visualisation in D3.js and Vue.js. The big problem with the data visualisation on the World Values Survey website is how hard it is to draw conclusions over time and to compare the values of many countries at the same time.

My solution was to create both a scatter plot and a parallel coordinates chart, and let the user explore the data. To discover development over time, there is the option to choose different time periods and se hw the data changes.
