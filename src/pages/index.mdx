# hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Axel, a **developer** and media technology student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I'm also passionate about **photography** and **experience design**.

<ProfileCard img={props.data.file.childImageSharp.fluid}>
  This is me.
</ProfileCard>

This spring I'm writing my master's thesis and doing an internship as a **DevOps Engineer** at Mentimeter.

Want to talk to me?
