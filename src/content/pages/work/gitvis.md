The gitvis application was build together with Ella Wirstad Gustafsson, as a part of the course "Visualization" I took during my exchange semester at Univeristy of Technology in Eindhoven. 

The purpose was to provide a more interactive and visual search experience for repositories on github, and to improve the possibilities to explore and compare repositories based on a search query.

The visualizations in the application was created with Vue.js and D3.js. For the interaction with the Github GraphQL API, we used Apollo GraphQL and to authenticate the user with Github, we used Firebase Auth.
