Right now, I'm working as a **Tech Manager** and **Software Developer** at the code lab [Prototyp](https://www.prototyp.se/), building digital products and services with great user experience. ðŸŽ‰

During the spring of 2020, I did an internship as a **DevOps Engineer** at [Mentimeter](https://mentimeter.com) and wrote my [master's thesis](/thesis) on the topic **Technical Debt Management**.
