# hello friend ðŸ‘‹

I'm Axel, a **software engineer** specialized in **human-computer interaction** and **information visualization**. I'm also a passionate **photographer**, a fan of the **open source community** and I love great **design**.

<ProfileCard>This is me.</ProfileCard>

Right now, I'm working as a **Tech Lead** and **Full-Stack Developer** at the code lab [Prototyp](https://www.prototyp.se/), building digital products and services with great user experience. ðŸŽ‰

During the spring of 2020, I did an internship as a **DevOps Engineer** at [Mentimeter](https://mentimeter.com) and wrote my [master's thesis](/thesis) on the topic **Technical Debt Management**.
